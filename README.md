# Maze Game
The first game I ever created. This was maded five years ago (so nostalgic!). I was starting learning how to program, and decided to create this simple game about collect coins in a maze with one monster.

I'm proud of it, has features like: collect coins, collisions with walls, life, achiviments and more!

This game uses ```conio2.h``` and ```DOS``` to run. Feel free to modify and learn from!

(Functions and variables is typing in portuguese, I don't want to change any line of code to stay the same code created five years ago, sorry!)
